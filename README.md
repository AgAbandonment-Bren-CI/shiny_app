# shiny_app

This Shiny app explores projections of cropland abandonment both globally and in our region of interest, Brazil. The global tab visualizes where abandonment overlays with areas important to carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Users can explore zonal statistics for abandonment across different countries at 50 km resolution. Within the Brazilian tab, this app explores where active restoration of projected cropland abandonment can provide the highest benefits to carbon and biodiversity.   


Markdowns within the 'data_processing' should be run before attempting to run the shiny script. These scripts produce intermediate rasters and datasets necessary for the shiny to function properly. 


Data sources:

**LULC:**
Data from Chen et al. (2022) is publically available and can be accessed here: https://zenodo.org/record/4584775#.YuMq8nbMK5c

**Carbon:**
Carbon sequestration data available at: https://data.globalforestwatch.org/documents/gfw::carbon-accumulation-potential-from-natural-forest-regrowth-in-reforestable-areas/about

**Biodiversity:**
Info on biodiv data and link to source

**Restoration cost:**
info on cost
maybe include this csv in repo since it is small
