# shiny_app

This Shiny app explores projections of cropland abandonment both globally and in our region of interest, Brazil. The global tab visualizes where abandonment overlays with areas important to carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Users can explore zonal statistics for abandonment across different countries at 50 km resolution. Within the Brazilian tab, this app explores where active restoration of projected cropland abandonment can provide the highest benefits to carbon and biodiversity.
